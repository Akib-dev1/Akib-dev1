# üí´ About Me:

Hi, I'm **Muhammad Akib Anjum** ‚Äî a passionate **MERN Stack Developer** with a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development.

With hands-on experience in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, React.js, Node.js, Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, I build full-stack web applications that are responsive, scalable, and secure. I also work with **Firebase** for real-time features and authentication, and implement **JWT** for secure user authorization.

Beyond web development, I have a working knowledge of **Java** and **C++**, giving me a strong grasp of OOP and data structures to solve complex problems efficiently.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies, build innovative solutions, and deliver high-quality user experiences.
